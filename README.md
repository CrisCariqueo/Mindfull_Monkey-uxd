## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. **The Problem**

> I just opened TikTok for a minute, and now three hours are gone.
> I can't focus on my work without checking Instagram.
> I can't sleep well and I'm always tired.

Today, a significant portion of the population is struggling with addiction to social media and other mobile applications. This addiction leads to a continuous cycle of distraction, decreased productivity, and negative impacts on mental well-being. People often feel a lack of control over their digital habits, losing valuable time and energy they could dedicate to more meaningful pursuits.

---

### 1.2. **Our Solution**

**Mindful Monkey** is an "aggressively non-invasive" digital wellness app designed to help users regain control of their digital habits. It provides a simple but powerful solution to the problem of screen addiction by granting users tools that proactively prevent the use of apps they have identified as harmful.

#### **Proactive Blocking**

- Mindful Monkey doesn't just send notifications or reminders; it physically blocks access to applications. When an app is blocked, the user cannot open it, removing the temptation and reliance on willpower.

#### **Scheduled Block Periods**

- The app allows users to schedule specific block periods in advance. For example, a user can set a schedule to block all social media apps from 9 AM to 5 PM on weekdays to stay focused during work hours.

#### **Customizable App Selection**

- Users have complete control over which apps are blocked. Whether it's social media, games, or streaming platforms, the system only blocks the applications the user identifies as a source of distraction.
> [!NOTE]  
> Mindful Monkey empowers users by giving them the tools to set their own digital boundaries, helping them live more intentionally.

## 3. Strategy

### 3.1. Value Proposition Canvas

*How we aligned user needs with our solution*

**Dual approach:**

1. **Users with clear options:** Exploration and comparison tools with up-to-date information.
2. **Lost or undecided users:** Vocational guidance test to narrow down options, plus a random degree explorer.

**Identified gaps:**

- **Social:** External pressure on decision-making.
- **Emotional:** Insecurity, fear of failure, or disappointing the family.
- **Technical:** Lack of attractive and integrated guidance platforms.

### 3.2. **UX Personas**

*Defined through behavioral observation of people suffering consciously or unconsciously suffering from screen addiction, these personas reflect the diverse realities and needs inspiring Mindfull Monkey.*

---

👥🔹 **Alex Chen**  
*"I feel like I'm always connected, but never actually focused on what matters."*

👥🔹 **Maria Garcia**  
*"The line between my work life and my home life has completely disappeared."*

👥🔹 **David Miller**  
*"Technology is wonderful for staying in touch, but I don't want it to consume my day."*

### 3.3. Benchmarking

To develop an application that truly meets the needs and expectations of our users, it was essential to analyze existing platforms — including both direct competitors and indirect references known for good design and usability.

The goal was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of current solutions, both functionally and visually, in order to incorporate best practices and avoid common pitfalls.

#### Types of platforms analyzed:

- 🌳 **Direct competitor**: The platform *Forest*, which provides similar functionalities.
- 📱 **Cellphone default focus app**: Services like *QuePlan* or *ComparaOnline*, valued for their clarity and organization.


![Benchmarking](./assets/benchmark.png)

## 4. Scope

### 4.1. Customer Journey Map

We identified four key stages in the user's interaction with Mindfull Monkey:

- 🔍 Awareness
- 🤔 Consideration
- ✅ Decision
- 💬 Loyalty & Advocacy

These stages reflect the complete journey — from first contact to long-term perception and potential recommendation.


![Customer Journey Map](./assets/customerJourney.png)

#### 4.1.1. Decision Stage Interfaces

**Customer Activities**
- Block apps.
- Schedule blocks within apps.
- Have a timer so you can use an app for a limited time.
- Read detailed reports of app use.

**Customer Goals**
- The user uses the app to be more productive.
- The user uses the app to moderate the use of distracting apps.
- The user wants to overcome his social media addiction issues.

**Touchpoints**

The user will be rewarded with increased productivity and less screen time wich together can lead to a healthier relationship with technology. They will be amused by all the time and mental health improvement making our app their best ally.

## 5. Structure

### 5.1. Navigation Flow

Mindfull Monkey app map outlines a user-centered and streamlined structure designed to reduce friction and improve accessibility. Its key sections include:

- **Home page**
- **Routines**
- **App block**
- **Monitoring**
- **Stopwatch**

> To maximize ease of access, the platform does **not require login or registration**, allowing people to explore all features freely without creating an account.

## 6. Skeleton

### 6.1. Low-fidelity wireframes

The wireframes developed serve as an initial approximation of the structure and visual layout of the interfaces tied to the system's core functionalities. Navigation between screens is primarily handled through a persistent top navigation bar, present across all interface screens.

In the early iterations, the interfaces were organized into three main categories:

+ Interfaces related to degree programs.

+ Interfaces related to vocational tests.

+ Interfaces related to student benefit.

📁 **[Wireframes Workspace – Vocación360 (Figma)](https://www.figma.com/design/xzcIdIPWxBuT59i8s7O3t0/Wireframes-Vocación360?t=7C1t74Ojj2hCTtnC-1)**

PDF version of the entire initial wireframe set, covering all main interface screens from the early design phase.

**As the design evolved, the student benefits section was removed.** The focus shifted toward vocational tests, detailed degree information, random exploration features, and degree program comparison tools. *(This evolution is detailed in the next section).*

### 7.1. Interface Evolution

## Interface Evolution Process: Explanations and Key Reasons for Modifications

In the initial versions of the interface, we included a top navigation bar with the following options: Home, Undergraduate Programs, Benefits, Points of Interest, About Us, and Login/Register. However, as we refined the project's scope, we decided to remove "Points of Interest" and temporarily disregard the Login/Register functionality. This was because user login would only provide access to test history—something that we replaced by allowing users to download their results for free, without requiring registration. Nonetheless, we do not rule out including this feature in future versions.

Our second consideration was the target audience: high school students seeking vocational guidance. These young users are often confused or overwhelmed, and requesting them to create an account or enter personal information at the outset might discourage them from engaging further, so we chose to simplify access as much as possible.

Additionally, between the wireframes and the final prototype, we made adjustments to margins and spacing to better align with web design standards seen in similar informational websites. These changes improve readability and the overall browsing experience.

**Home Interface Evolution**

The original home wireframe offered options for taking tests, exploring programs, and searching scholarships. In the high-definition version, a minimalist design was adopted with fewer visible buttons and a calming forest background in blue and turquoise tones. The navigation bar became collapsible, featuring a subtle orange hover effect.

![Home Interface Evolution](./assets/ui-evolution-home.png)


**Academic Program Interface Evolution**

The academic program view originally used side menus, but was redesigned with top navigation buttons for greater consistency across sections. In the specific section on weightings, a donut chart was added to visually display the percentage value of each PAES component.

![Weightings Interface Evolution](./assets/ui-evolution-weightings.png)

**Interest Test Interface Evolution**

Initially, test questions showed their number and multiple-choice options, along with the total count in the center. In the updated version, a progress bar was added and a Likert scale was used, providing a clearer and more intuitive way to measure user interest.

![Interest Test Interface Evolution](./assets/ui-evolution-interest-test.png)

**However, these represented the initial iterations of what would later become the final high-fidelity interfaces.**

***

#### Redesign of the navigable prototype

When presenting the first version, it was concluded that while the prototype’s functionalities were structurally sound, it failed to convey what a tool aimed at high school students truly should.

> *It did not address the students’ main fears. It overlooked the importance of visual design for a teenage audience, and most importantly, it lacked the soul that a prototype meant to guide one’s future should have.*

For this reason, a new iteration was carried out, resulting in the current version—one that not only redefined functionalities but also reimagined the prototype’s identity.

✅ **New purple-toned color palette:** Avoiding entirely blue tones, which can feel too formal, and reddish tones, which may undermine the tool’s seriousness.

✅ **Branched vocational orientation test:** The previous version had neglected what should have been *the essence of Vocación360*: the ability to guide students from diverse backgrounds. This version includes:

- Students who feel completely lost: *What are their interests? In which subjects do they perform well? Which ones do they avoid?*
- Students who have options but can’t decide: *The dilemma between what they want and what others expect. Also, what are their routines? Their priorities? How aligned are they with that option?*

✅ **Random search feature:** Aimed at opening students’ minds to paths they may have never considered, and helping them discover lesser-known fields within the country.

✅ **Exploration and comparison of options:** Because informed decisions also require concrete data and comparative analysis.

As the design was iterated, the home screen was updated to prioritize violet tones and more direct calls to action. However, further iterations were made following the heuristic evaluation *(see the next section)*.

### 7.2. Results of the Heuristic Evaluation

A heuristic evaluation of *Vocación360* was conducted during its redesign phase, at a point where several features were still under development, such as the degree program comparator, test results, second test branching, and detailed degree program information. Despite this, the prototype already conveyed a clear visual identity. The evaluation yielded an average **SUS score of 68.75**, which we consider a promising result for the development stage.

However, several usability issues were identified and addressed before reaching the final version. The most relevant ones are detailed below:

---

| **Problem**                                                  | **Solution**                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The top navigation bar did not indicate the user’s current section. Additionally, the test lacked clear progress segmentation. | The top nav bar was updated to highlight the current section in orange and underline items on hover. The test was divided into distinct progress stages. |

![Heuristic Evaluation Navbar](./assets/heuristic-evaluation-navbar.png)

---

| **Problem**                                                  | **Solution**                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The test interface did not indicate completion progress, which is common in similar platforms. | A progress bar was added to each test stage across both branches. |

![Heuristic Evaluation Progress Bar](./assets/heuristic-evaluation-progress-bar.png)

---

| **Problem**                                                  | **Solution**                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Low visual contrast in selected buttons and lack of options like "Skip" in questions. | Button contrast was improved using green/red tones to reflect ease/difficulty. A "Skip" option was added in the identity section. |

![Heuristic Evaluation "Skip" Button and Contrast](./assets/heuristic-evaluation-skip-button-contrast.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The "Skip" option was only added in the identity section. In other parts of the test, where questions are multiple choice and essential for orientation, it was intentionally excluded.

> [!NOTE]  
> A suggestion was made to change button colors based on subjects, but it was discarded to preserve the consistent purple-toned visual identity of the site.

---

| **Problem**                                                  | **Solution**                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The main homepage image of a girl studying was not representative of the platform’s purpose and took up excessive space. | It was replaced with images of two students exploring their interests—reading and programming—and resized to better balance the layout. |

![Heuristic Evaluation Home Page](./assets/heuristic-evaluation-home.png)

---

#### Additional heuristic-based improvements:

+ Footer section added.
+ Clear instructions on whether questions are single or multiple choice.
+ "Back" option included in each test stage.
+ Descriptive labels added to NavBar options.
+ References to official information sources included for data credibility.

### 7.3. High Definition Interfaces

After multiple iterations and the improvements guided by the heuristic evaluation, the final high-fidelity interfaces for **Vocación360** are presented below. These interfaces were built using atomic and composite components, along with a variety of component states to reflect different visual and interaction conditions.

But now the key question is:

> **Does this final prototype truly support high school students in their decision-making?**

Revisiting our UX personas, we can now conclude the following:

👥🔹 **Catalina González** can now follow the second path of the vocational test to explore and compare different **degree program** options, while also reviewing hard data through the degree program comparison tool.

👥🔹 **Sofía Araya** is now able to show her family reliable data from the Ministry of Education to validate her chosen **degree program**. She can also filter program options based on the **Art** category, aligning with her interests.

👥🔹 **Jorge Muñoz** can use the search bar to find engineering **degree programs** with shorter durations and more accessible tuition and enrollment fees. He can also view key scholarships directly within each university's degree information page.
